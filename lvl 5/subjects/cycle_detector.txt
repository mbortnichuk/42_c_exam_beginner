Assignment name: cycle_detector
Expected files: cycle_detector.c
Allowed functions: malloc, free
-------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------

Create a cycle_detector function that takes a "const t_list * list" in
argument, which will verify that there is no cycle inside the chained list
list.

A cycle is defined when, during the course of the list, you spend at least 2
times through the same link.

This function will return 1 if the function detects a cycle, otherwise it will return 0.

This function will be prototyped as follows:

int cycle_detector (const t_list * list)

The type "t_list" is defined as follows:

typedef struct s_list
{
     int data;
     struct s_list * next;
} t_list;

This type will be provided in the header "list.h". You do not need to provide it,
we will use our in correction.
