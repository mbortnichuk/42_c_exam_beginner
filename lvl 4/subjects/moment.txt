Create a function that takes an unsigned int parameter, representing a
potential duration in seconds, and returns a string that indicates the
number of seconds / minutes / hours / days or months elapsed.
We assume that the months are 30 days long and we do not know the leap years.

The output format will be:

xxx {second(s)|minute(s)|hour(s)|day(s)|month(s)} ago.

Your function will only return the duration with the lowest possible value.
The function will be prototyped as follows:

 char    *moment(unsigned int duration)

Examples:

moment(0)       => 0 seconds ago.
moment(1)       => 1 second ago.
moment(30)      => 30 seconds ago.
moment(65)      => 1 minute ago.
moment(120)     => 2 minutes ago.
moment(2400)    => 40 minutes ago.
moment(3735)    => 1 hour ago.
